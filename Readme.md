## Contribution guidelines

To contribute to this project, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click on the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the repository's page. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository**: On your local machine, open a terminal and run the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pranav-singhal/postman-swift-app
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch**: Change to the project's directory using the command:

   ```
   cd postman-swift-app
   ```

   Next, create a new branch for your contributions. It is recommended to give your branch a descriptive name that reflects the changes you intend to make. For example:

   ```
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```

4. **Make Changes**: Now it's time to make the desired changes or additions to the project code or files. Use your preferred code editor to modify the relevant files.

5. **Commit Changes**: Once you've made the necessary changes, it's time to commit them. Run the following command to stage your changes:

   ```
   git add .
   ```

   This will stage all modified and new files. If you want to stage specific files, replace `.` with the file names.

   Next, commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:

   ```
   git commit -m "Add my new feature"
   ```

6. **Push Changes**: Push your committed changes to your forked repository:

   ```
   git push origin my-feature-branch
   ```

   Replace `my-feature-branch` with the name of your branch.

7. **Create a Pull Request**: Now that your changes are pushed to your forked repository, you can create a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the original repository. Go to the original repository's page on GitHub and click on the "New Pull Request" button.

   Select your branch from the "base" dropdown menu (the original repository) and the branch containing your changes from the "compare" dropdown menu (your forked repository).

   Fill in a descriptive title and description for your pull request, explaining the changes you've made. Once you're ready, click on the "Create Pull Request" button.

Congratulations! You've successfully created a pull request. Your changes will now be reviewed by the project maintainers. They may provide feedback or request further modifications before merging your changes into the main project.

Thank you for contributing to the **Postman Mobile** repository! We appreciate your support and look forward to your contributions.
